// react router dom
// app call - header authorization - jwt
// git

// homework session 21
// 1- PDP, service implementation from https://dummyjson.com/
https://dummyjson.com/docs/products#products-single

please integrate service to this component and show data coming from service in front. you might use some of the data not all of them, the decision is yours!
no need to give me perfect ui, first goal is to see the data, then nice css and structure,

// 2- panel, auth, users, profile, panel - please complete users page, add table or list to render users data
